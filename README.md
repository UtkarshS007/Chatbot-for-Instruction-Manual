# Chatbot-for-Instruction-Manual

This project implements a chatbot capable of answering questions based on uploaded instruction manuals. By leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), the chatbot effectively processes and understands complex documents, providing users with accurate and informative responses. The system incorporates document preprocessing, embedding generation, vector database storage, and a user-friendly interface to deliver a seamless user experience.
